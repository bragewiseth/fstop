### Early Development

The setup of the new game engine is coming along.
For now the current goal is to abstract away some functionallity and make the engine more future proof.
All the pipline stuff is grouped togheter, the reason beeeing that the pipeline needs information about the different layouts.
this allows you to set a layout struct to base every resource around.
